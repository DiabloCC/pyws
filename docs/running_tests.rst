Running tests
=============

This chapter explains how to run pyws interoperability tests, for detailed
description of the test bench, refer to :ref:`test_bench`. These tests can also
be treated as examples of how different clients work with pyws.

You can run all the tests (except WS-I Basic Profile ones, about which read
below) using one single command::

    make

However, each set of tests has it own requirements, which you can learn below.

In any case we need a pyws server running, but all tests deal with it
themselves, so don't bother yourself with it and just keep reading.


PHP
----

Base directory is ``[pyws_dir]/tests/php``.

Surely, we need to have PHP installed, I use PHP 5.3.3. We need to have
PHPUnit installed as well, I use PHPUnit 3.4.13. To generate PHP classes from
a WSDL file, I use a slightly modified version of ``wsdl2php.php`` script
(the original comes from http://www.urdalen.no/wsdl2php/, support of ``date``
type was added), so this script is included in the project.

Running PHP tests is easy::

    make


Java (Axis)
-----------

Base directory is ``[pyws_dir]/tests/java/axis``.

Of course, we need to have Java installed, I use Java 1.6.0_26. We also need
to have Apache Axis and JUnit4 installed, I use Apache Axis 1.4 and JUnit
4.8.2. Probably, you may also need to edit ``common.sh`` and change
``JAVA_DIR`` to the directory containing Java libraries. In my case it is
``/usr/share/java``.

To run Java tests, again, just run::

    make


Python (suds)
-------------

Base directory is ``[pyws_dir]/tests/python/suds``.

We need to have suds and unittest2 installed.

You might have guessed::

    make


WS-I Basic Profile 1.2
----------------------

This test checks if WSDL file generated by pyws is compliant to `WS-I Basic
Profile 1.2 <http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.2-2010-11-09.html>`_.

Base directory is ``[pyws_dir]/tests/java/ws-i``.

Requirements are the same as for Axis integration tests, except that we don't
need JUnit, but we do need an XSLT 2.0 processor. I use Saxon B 0.9, if you
use another one, you should specify it in ``xslt.sh`` in variable ``SAXON``.

Run the test::

    make

It will download WS-I Test Tools (about 6MB) and generate ``report.xml`` file.
All we have to do is to open it (for example, with Mozilla Firefox Web browser)
and check if there are any "failed" assertions. If there ain't any, then it's
OK. Otherwise, you can find further in the document the causes of the failure
and report them to me :). But I find it unlikely, I usually run this test too.

To clean generated report files::

    make clean_report


Known problems
--------------

In rare cases, a pyws server is not halted after the tests (have figured why so
far), so you'll have to kill it yourself, this command might help::

    ps ax | grep 'python __init__.py' | grep -v grep
