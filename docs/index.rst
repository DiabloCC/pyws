Welcome to pyws's documentation!
================================

Good day!

I hope this document will help you working with pyws. If you have any comments,
questions, suggestions, problems, or anything else to say, feel free to contact
me via email stepankk@gmail.com. pyws code is hosted on GitHub at
https://github.com/stepank/pyws.


Requirements
============

pyws itself depends only on python standard library and lxml. However, at
present, there is only one adapter, the one for Django, so you also need Django
(I use 1.3). I've tested pyws on python 2.6 and python 2.7.
