Examples
========

Okay, there have been a lot of theory and only a few real examples so far. Now,
we are going to walk through some more of them.

In pyws distribution there is a directory called ``examples``, let's have a
look at its contents::

    _django/                # files for django based examples
        templates/
            test_form.html
        __init__.py
        manage.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
    __init__.py
    api_settings.py         # common pyws server settings
    authenticate.py         # authentication related stuff
    functions.py            # example functions
    server.py               # server definition
